SBIG all-sky 340c driving utilite
===============================

Run `make` to compile three binary files:

* `sbig340_standalone` --- standalone utility (no daemon/client)
* `sbig340_daemon` --- pure grabbing daemon (driven by socket)
* `sbig340_client` --- pure client (take images from daemon and save locally)
